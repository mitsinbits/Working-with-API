# Working-with-API

I Have used the API of a Weather Website to get the data about Earthquake and by using Python Libraries such as Json,Plotly etc.
I have used data poits which describes the place and magnitude of Earthquake.

Secondly I have used API of Github to find out the top-Rated Python Projects and plot a histogram of it.
I used requests and plotly in it.
